### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### My Process

I started out with the html first using h1,h2,h3 to add semantic meaning to the structure. Then i started out with the css by first creating variables for the colors i intended to reuse throughout my challenge. Then after centering the div finally tackled the css styling setting more flexible values rather than fixed values to handle responsiveness across variedly sized streaming devices.
